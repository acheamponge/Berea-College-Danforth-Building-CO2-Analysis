## MQ-7 Carbon Monoxide Gas Sensor ADC121C 12-Bit ADC I2C Mini Module

Dosen't appear to need any sort of special libraries but won't know until we plug it in. May need a convertor for the raspberry Pi.
We will know furthur down the line when we are able to work on coding. 
Can be used with the arduino though.
