# Prelim Code Structure


**Author(s)**:_*Nick Straub-Deck*_

## Start
Declare global variables for the CO and CO2 levels that will be changable through the  entire project. Will also need to delcare any
variables that need to be included if a new library is needed for this equipmen if they need to be included. Create a file for the data 
retention regarding the information gathered during the testing so it can be stored and displayed at some point in the future. 

## Start of Info Gathering
After connecting the parts together, set up the info gathering functions via the way the sensors require. If they need any special 
variables/libraries/inputs, set them up here. Using this functions set the limit for how much air we are measuring and the time span it has
to wait before scanning again.

## Actual Info Gathering
Using the new limits and the variables we set up, create the main section of the code that  will do all the important bits. If we have 
missed something along the way, go back and add it to the earlier steps. Since we are sensing two things we will need to have the two 
seperate values returned to us, one for each of the C0 and C02 levels

## Data Logging
Teamwork four will allow us to know how to do this step. Will data log to a table for reading. WIll save if able to. Might add a feature to
display the data if possible.

## Presentaion
Might be done in the data logging step. If it is not, we will save the file and display the data here.
